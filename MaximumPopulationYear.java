You are given a 2D integer array logs where each logs[i] = [birthi, deathi] indicates the birth and death years of the ith person.

The population of some year x is the number of people alive during that year.
The ith person is counted in year x's population if x is in the inclusive range [birthi, deathi - 1].
Note that the person is not counted in the year that they die.

Return the earliest year with the maximum population.
